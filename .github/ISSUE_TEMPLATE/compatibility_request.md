## Description
We need to ensure the compatibility with the next version of OpenSearch vX.X.
This update is still being discussed, but we need to be aware of potential issues.

For that, we need to:

- [ ] Review opensearch's release notes.
- [ ] Identify improvements and potential impact.
- [ ] Create new development branch.
- [ ] Develop a testing environment to verify our components would work under this new build.

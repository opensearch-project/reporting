## Description
We need to ensure the compatibility with the next version of OpenSearch vX.X.
This update is still being discussed, but we need to be aware of potential issues.

For that, we need to:

- [ ] Migrate our changes on top of OpenSearch's reporting plugin v2.X.X.0 tag. Follow the [Maintainers Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NjPyyp6V6HwjmgCHY_mL-ywdtqtc1Ac4pZ44QcbIpz8/edit?usp=sharing).

## Welcome!

The Wazuh Indexer is a highly scalable, full-text search and analytics engine. This Wazuh central component indexes and stores alerts generated by the Wazuh server and provides near real-time data search and analytics capabilities.

Wazuh Indexer is an open source fork of [OpenSearch](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch).

This repository stores the source code of the Wazuh Indexer Reporting Plugin and its configurations.

## Wazuh Indexer Reporting Plugin

Wazuh Indexer Reporting allows ‘Report Owner’ (engineers, including but not limited to developers, DevOps, IT Engineer, and IT admin) export and share reports from Wazuh Dashboard's dashboards, saved search, alerts and visualizations. It helps automate the process of scheduling reports on an on-demand or a periodical basis (on cron schedules as well). Further, it also automates the process of exporting and sharing reports triggered for various alerts. The feature is present in the Dashboard, Discover, and Visualization tabs. We are currently working on integrating Dashboards Reports with Notifications to enable sharing functionality. After the support is introduced, scheduled reports can be sent to (shared with) self or various stakeholders within the organization. These stakeholders include but are not limited to, executives, managers, engineers (developers, DevOps, IT Engineer) in the form of PDF, hyperlinks, CSV, excel via various channels such as email, Slack, and Amazon Chime. However, in order to export, schedule and share reports, report owners should have the necessary permissions as defined under Roles and Privileges.
